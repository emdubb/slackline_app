#Slackline Application

## Hold the phone, what is a slackline???

Slacklining is a balance sport. It is done by setting up a line made of nylon webbing between two trees and poles and walking across the line. The line is pulled tight by either a rachet or carabiner system. Even though the line is tight, it has give to it (giving it the name "slack"lining) and thus you can bounce and get down with your crazy self and do tricks.

CHALLENGE: Slackling has a substaintial community built around it but it is not widely recognized, so finding locations to set up a line is challenging. Slackers are often kicked out of parks because it is thought to damage trees (which it does not), or the sport is perceived as dangerous.

SOLUTION: This application allows slackers to post the location of their lines. All users will be able to see a list of posted lines allowing the slackline community to foster and provide slackers with places they can practice with fellow slackers.
